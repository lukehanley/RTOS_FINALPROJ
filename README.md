Marble labyrinth game


WEEK 1:
So far the project seems like a lot to wrap my head around but breaking it down and doing this up front planning seems like it while be worthwhile, albeit tedious. At a certain point it is better to just start the project because we only know so much know, and as I start the meat of the project I will learn more that will change my plan. I built out a task diagram, risk register with two risks,  a couple unit test ideas, and a list of work items with estimated lengths. 

I like how I have the tasks set up, I think it breaks up a lot of the meat of execution into different tasks instead of having one massive physics engine task.

WEEK 2:

Updated probability of senioritis risk because it is really starting to hit, as well as added a new risk that became apparent to me as I worked. Set up project overhead and intialized all data structures and tasks. Finished gyroscope task that updates the global var with both angles of the board rotation. Edited unit tests to make more explicit and testable. Added functional tests.
