Marble labyrinth game


WEEK 1:
So far the project seems like a lot to wrap my head around but breaking it down and doing this up front planning seems like it while be worthwhile, albeit tedious. At a certain point it is better to just start the project because we only know so much know, and as I start the meat of the project I will learn more that will change my plan. I built out a task diagram, risk register with two risks,  a couple unit test ideas, and a list of work items with estimated lengths. 

I like how I have the tasks set up, I think it breaks up a lot of the meat of execution into different tasks instead of having one massive physics engine task.
